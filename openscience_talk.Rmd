# Introduction

*Define #openscience* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science)

```
Open science is the movement to make scientific research, 
data and dissemination accessible to all levels of 
an inquiring society, amateur or professional.

*Define #openscience* [FOSTER](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/foster-taxonomy/open-science-definition)

```
Open Science is the practice of science in such a way that others can collaborate and contribute,
where research data, lab notes and 
other research processes are freely available, 
under terms that enable reuse, redistribution and 
reproduction of the research and 
its underlying data and methods. 
```

*Define #openscience* [Openscience.org](http://www.openscience.org/blog/?p=269)

```
... four fundamental goals:

- Transparency in experimental methodology, 
observation, and collection of data.
- Public availability and reusability of 
scientific data.
- Public accessibility and transparency of 
scientific communication.
- Using web-based tools to facilitate 
scientific collaboration.
